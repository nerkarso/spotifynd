# Spotifind

Find the track you forgot you have in your Spotify library.

## Motivation

There is a huge collection of tracks in my Spotify library but the existing service doesn't offer a feature to search for tracks in my collection, so I have decided to built my own.

## Usage

1. Log in with your Spotify account.
2. Grant permissions.
3. Search for tracks in your collection.
